# Robotics-final-project
This is the final robotics project of the AzaBrothers' team. Python code is used to get the person's coordinates, and then it sends the step coordinates to move the servos. Arduino receives the input from Python and moves the servo, and turns on/off the laser. So basically it is human tracking: a camera on servo moves so that the person stays in the center of the frame and turns on the laser
How to run: upload Arduino code, close the serial monitor if it is opened and then run Python code
